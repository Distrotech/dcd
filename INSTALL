Unfortunately, these instructions got rather more complicated. Thank the 
fine people at MusicBrainz, who abandoned their sleek, sexy, simple "CD 
Index" project in favor of the fully-buzzword-compliant (XML! Distributed! 
Goofy name with a Z at the end!) service they now offer...

You'll first have to install libmusicbrainz, available from
http://www.musicbrainz.org/download.html

Their library requires the full suite of C++ stuff, including libstdc++ 
and a C++ compiler. I wish I could do something about that.

Anyway. Once that's installed (presumably in /usr/local somewhere), you 
can proceed with building dcd proper.


* Look at the Makefile.
  There are a few things you might want to change:
  * If /dev/cdrom isn't a symlink to your "real" CD-ROM device, either edit
    the Makefile or create the symlink as appropriate.
  * You might want to enable the debugging flags. But probably not.
  * Various other configuration options which are explained much better
    in the Makefile. 

* Type `make'. Then type `make install' or just copy the binary (dcd)
  and manual page (dcd.1) somewhere useful.
