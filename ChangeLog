0.99.1 "thinner"
	Removed network support (it's in the Makefile) for Thinstation.
0.99 "sf.net"
	Basically, moved to SourceForge. That's pretty much it.
0.98 "Holy..."
     Pulled  out all the CD Index stuff, since that site apparently
       suffered heat death or something... Replaced it with massive
       ugly dependencies on libmusicbrainz.
     The above means that libstcd++, libmusicbrainz, and libm are REQUIRED.
     Added compression to local storage. Though not strictly required,
       you may wish to clean out your $HOME/.cdindex directory. (I think
       I've covered all the likely errors but I make few promises.)
     Bugs fixed after the above lobotomy: fixed the "no match found" bug.
     Added Robert Tol's "un-pause even if we're not really paused" patch.
0.96 "Nomic"
     Added Othmar Pasteka's "is there even a CD in the drive" patch which
       was so simple I shoulda done it years ago. :-)
0.95 "Not again..."
     Replaced base64.c with a more GPL-friendly version.
0.94 "Unstable Tina"
     Actually check return value for DNS lookup, since cdindex.org
       seems to be broken right about now.
     Named in honour of Unstable Tina (www.unstabletina.com), an
       incredibly cool local band. If you're in Saint Louis, drop by a show!
0.93 "One Billion"
     Fixed the "no-info" warning displayed twice bug. Not really fixed
       perhaps, but made it go away...
     Named in honour of the one billionth second of the UNIX epoch 
       (September 9, 2001, 1:46:40 AM GMT). Or Dr. Evil. Who knows?
0.92 "Lorenz"
     Named after Lorenz Minder <lminder@gmx.net> who provided a bucket
       full of useful libcdplay patches. Thanks! The most important one
       is that dcd now uses the CDROMSTART ioctl instead of CDROMSTOP.
       If this causes problems, please let me know ASAP.
     Added a compile-time option to make dcd be quiet about CDs that
       the CD Index doesn't know about.
     Truncate track names at 64 characters, so things still fit neatly
       on the standard 80-column screen.
     Plenty of file fixes, so that things like a non-existent ~/.cdindex
       directory shouldn't make dcd crash and burn anymore.
     Added "examples" to the man page.
     Reversed the changelog so newer stuff is at the top. :-)
0.90 "Quad Damage"
     Endian fix (thanks to that guy from debian)
     `z' option -- useful for shell scripts (mostly MP3 ripping)
     `a' option -- like the above but backwards. :-)
     `k' option -- kills off dcd (in case things start running away)
     I think I've finally fixed the lingering `info doesn't work' bit.
0.81 "CGB Spender" (if you don't know, don't ask)
     Bug: 0.80 doesn't like cdindex.org. Fixed.
0.80 "Felicity"
     Took out the old 'b' option which was really goofy, and added the
       new (b)ack and (f)orward options to skip about the disc. Hacks
       on dcd.c, cd-misc.c, cd-misc.h, screenop.c as appropriate.
     Finally put useful CD Index code in. cdindex.c hacked all to hell.
     Rewrote process handler code to be far more sane internally (using
       FILE instead of icky read/write). process.c beaten heavily.
     Added networking code, courtesy of LordVader @Dalnet. Still more
       rewrites on cdindex.c, screenop.c. 'connect' command option added.
0.70 "Roswell Grey"
     Added u and b options for CD Index URLs. 'x' now merely chucks out
       the disc id, which frankly isn't too useful.
     Added `dcd p' to pause/resume the disc. And it works this time too.
     libcdplay.c: do smart things when disc isn't playing (cd_current_track)
     libcdplay.c: rearranged a few boring internals
     Fixed all freeamp.org URL references to point to cdindex.org
0.60 "Feature Creep"
     Added `dcd x' to generate CD Index discids. Added base64.c and sha.c
       in support of that. (See those files for (C) info.)
     Added all PID maintenance code, thanks to Lalo Martins' nagging :)
     Re-added `dcd n' to go with PID management; it now bumps an existing
       dcd process to its next track (or next random track, or whatever)
       Added process.c which has all that stuff, including ugly filestuff.
     screenop.c: Fixed the helpscreen.
     random now can take a tracklist too.
     Rewrote changelog so it looks all professional.
     Added check for data track to libcdplay.c and screenop.c
0.51 "Syndrome"
     Added `quit' to avoid exiting immediately, works great for playlists.
     screenop.c: various cleanups, thanks to Alvaro Herrera
     Started giving versions clever names like tin prereleases.
0.50 Removed `next' and `previous' command switches. dcd.c was almost
     completely rewritten.
0.40 Added `stop CD player on SIGTERM'. Some internal cleanups. `dcd loop'
     without a tracklist now plays the whole disc.
0.35 Added `eject'
